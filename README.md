FROM enrollment, instructor, section
WHERE instructor.name = 'Einstein'
AND instructor.instructor_id = section.instructor_id
AND enrollment.section_id = section.section_id;
```

**37. Find all students who have not taken a course.**

```sql
SELECT student_id
FROM student
WHERE student_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT student_id FROM enrollment);
```
